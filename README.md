# PSOBB FPS Counter Addon
FPS Counter Addon for Phantasy Star Online: Blue Burst

## Requirements
Requires the PSOBBMod Plugin.  I recommend Solybum's updated version, here: https://github.com/Solybum/psobbaddonplugin/releases/tag/v0.3.5.4

## Installation
Copy the FPS_Counter directory into your addons/ folder.

## Use
Creates a draggable window that displays instantaneous FPS, and average FPS over 1 second and 10 seconds.

To close the window, use the "FPS Counter" button in the PSOBBMod main menu (accessed by pressing the backtick (\`) key).
