# PSOBB FPS Counter Addon
FPS Counter Addon for Phantasy Star Online: Blue Burst

## Requirements
Requires the PSOBBMod Plugin.  I recommend Solybum's updated version, here: https://github.com/Solybum/psobbaddonplugin/releases/tag/v0.3.5.4

## Installation
Copy the FPS_Counter directory into your addons/ folder.

## Use
Options:

 - Enable: enable or disable the FPS window
 - Show Graphs: when on, shows historical graphs (about 1 minute of data) for each selected metric
 - Show Current FPS: shows instantaneous FPS
 - Show 1s Average FPS: shows FPS as averaged over the last second
 - Show 10s Average FPS: shows FPS as averaged over the last 10 seconds
 
 To show the configuration window again, use the "FPS Counter" button in the PSOBBMod Main Menu.

## Utility
This addon's utility is questionable, given that PSOBB is a 16 year old game (as of this commit), and it's frame-capped at 30FPS.  But my laptop was dropping frames, so I used this to figure out some better settings.
